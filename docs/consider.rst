Things to consider
-------------------

* Maybe you're really just interested in continuous integration and continuous benchmarking for your application and don't want to manage all of the infrastructure. Fluid Numerics offers a fully managed solution; simply point us to your repository. We'll pass forward costs of Google Cloud and maintain your infrastructure for at a rate that depends on the number of build minutes and the vCPU and GPU hours used. This way you're only billed when you're using our managed solution.

* If you'd like a quicker method for deploying fluid-run infrastructure on your own project, we have a private catalog with click-to-deploy solutions. Reach out to Fluid Numerics to learn how to get access.

* By default, the RCC cluster deploys with a VM image that is licensed to you for free with no technical support. Fluid Numerics offers technical support as well as cloud architecting and engineering services to help you get up and running quickly. Start a conversation with us and let us help make your transition to cloud easy.
